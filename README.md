# Simple Linear Regression from Scratch

# Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of linear regression from scratch using Python. The project aims to understand the mathematics behind linear regression and to implement it without relying on pre-built libraries.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is educational. By writing the linear regression algorithm from scratch, we gain a deeper understanding of how it works and the mathematics behind it. This exercise helps improve our understanding of concepts such as gradient descent, cost functions, and parameter optimization.

# Implementation Details

Dependencies: The project utilizes NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, computation, and visualization, respectively.
Dataset: The dataset used is "student_scores.csv", containing two columns: "Hours" (input feature) and "Scores" (target variable).
Algorithm: The linear regression algorithm is implemented from scratch, including functions for computing the cost, gradient, and performing gradient descent to optimize parameters.
Training and Testing: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
Usage

# To run the code:

Clone the repository.
Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
Results
After training the model, it achieves an R-squared score of approximately 96.78%, indicating a strong fit to the data.

# Note
This implementation is for educational purposes and understanding the fundamentals of linear regression. For practical use, it is recommended to use established machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, which provide optimized implementations.
